# üéµ Music School Website (Frontend with Next.js)

Welcome to my **Next.js learning project** ‚Äî a responsive, modern **Music School Website** where users can explore and enroll in music courses.

This project marks my **first experience with the Next.js framework**, where I focused on building a fully functional **frontend** using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **HTML**, and **TypeScript**. While the backend is not yet implemented, this project has helped me build a strong foundation in how real-time web applications are structured and deployed.

## üöÄ Project Overview

- A frontend-only music school platform
- Users can browse music course cards with **3D styled UI elements**
- Clean, responsive layout using **Tailwind CSS**
- Entire frontend developed using **Next.js and TypeScript**
- Created as part of my **learning journey** as a self-taught developer

## üìå Purpose of the Project

> This website was developed with a **learning-first approach**, to understand how modern frameworks like **Next.js** work. The focus was on exploring project structure, reusability, component-based architecture, and styling with utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind.
